//! Internal PIC co-processor service.
//!
//! The PIC32 is the Deluge's I/O co-processor: pads, buttons, indicator LEDs,
//! and the OLED chip-select handshake all flow over its UART. Several
//! capabilities ([`Oled`](crate::Oled), [`Input`](crate::Input),
//! [`Pads`](crate::Pads), [`Leds`](crate::Leds)) depend on it, so the SDK
//! brings it up once, on demand, and runs a single RX pump that routes incoming
//! events.
//!
//! [`ensure_started`] is idempotent: the first capability that needs the PIC
//! initialises the UART and spawns the RX pump; later callers are no-ops.
//! Backend bodies live in [`crate::plat`].
