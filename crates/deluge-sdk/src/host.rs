//! Host (desktop-simulator) backend, active when an app is built for the host
//! triple by `cargo deluge sim` (`cfg(not(target_os = "none"))`).
//!
//! On the device the capability modules talk to `deluge-bsp` peripherals; on the
//! host they talk to a [`SharedPanel`] instead — the in-memory link the simulator
//! GUI renders from. This module owns the process-wide handles (the panel and the
//! app side of the audio bridge), set up once by [`crate::__rt::host::run`] before
//! any app code runs, mirroring the device's global-static peripheral pattern.
