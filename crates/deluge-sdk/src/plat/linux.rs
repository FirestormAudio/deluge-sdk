//! Native Linux backend ops (real `libdeluge`, via `deluge-hal-linux`).
//!
//! Implemented: audio, OLED, pads, indicator/gold/sync LEDs, pad brightness,
//! input, jacks, CV/gate, DIN MIDI, trigger-clock input.
//!
//! Not implemented (`unimplemented!()`): `sd_*`. The SDK's `Sd` is a
//! sector-backed FAT abstraction, but on this backend the kernel has already
//! mounted the card (`/init` mounts it as vfat on `/sd`), so raw sector access
//! would contend with the VFS. What this backend should expose instead is an
//! open design question.
//!
//! Two conventions apply throughout this file:
//!
//! - **Coordinate origins differ.** libdeluge/the kernel are top-origin for the
//!   pad grid; the SDK is bottom-origin (set by the device backend). Anything
//!   touching pad coordinates must flip, on *both* the input and output paths —
//!   see `pads_flush` and the input pump.
//! - **Errors log rather than propagate.** Most `plat` ops are infallible in the
//!   SDK's signatures, because the device backend cannot fail at them (a GPIO
//!   write has no error path). Here they can, so they `log::warn!` and continue
//!   with the least-surprising fallback rather than panicking an app over, say,
//!   an absent LED.
