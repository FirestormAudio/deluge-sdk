//! Embassy time driver for the RZ/A1L, backed by OSTM0 and OSTM1.
//!
//! ## Hardware layout
//!
//! | Channel | Mode                         | Role                         |
//! |---------|------------------------------|------------------------------|
//! | OSTM0   | Free-running + CMP interrupt | 32-bit monotonic clock base  |
//! | OSTM1   | Interval + interrupt         | One-shot alarm               |
//!
//! ## Clock and tick rate
//!
//! OSTM0 runs at P0φ = 33,064,062.5 Hz on the Deluge. The Embassy tick rate is
//! 1 MHz (1 µs per tick); `now()` converts OSTM0 ticks with the exact 21161/640
//! ticks-per-µs rational from [`crate::time_math`].
//!
//! ## Overflow handling for `now()`
//!
//! OSTM0 is 32-bit and wraps every ~129.9 s. The 64-bit clock is extended **in software**:
//! `raw_ostm_ticks` compares each CNT sample against the last published one and treats CNT going
//! backwards as a wrap, so the extension is monotonic by construction and no interrupt is on the
//! correctness path (see `LAST_RAW`). The wrap arithmetic lives in [`crate::time_math`], where
//! it is host-tested.
//!
//! ## Alarm
//!
//! `schedule_wake(at, waker)` adds the waker to a software queue and, if it
//! is the earliest pending wake-up, programs OSTM1 in interval mode for
//! `at - now()` ticks. The OSTM1 ISR calls `Queue::handle_alarm`, which
//! wakes all expired tasks and returns the next expiration time; we re-arm
//! for that if needed.

/// CNT sample against the previous one: CNT going backwards means the counter wrapped. The wrap is
/// therefore detected by whoever reads the clock, not by an interrupt.
///
/// # Why not an ISR-maintained epoch counter
///
/// An epoch advanced by the OSTM0 wrap interrupt is wrong whenever that interrupt is **late**
/// (pending behind a same-or-higher-priority handler or a critical section): CNT has already
/// wrapped to a small value while the epoch has not advanced, so `now()` returns a value one full
/// epoch (2^32 ticks, ~129.9 s) in the past. `try_set_alarm` computes `at - now`, so a rewound
/// `now` arms OSTM1 for its maximum and every timer-driven task stalls.
///
/// Software extension removes the ISR from the correctness path: `now()` is monotonic by
/// construction however late any interrupt is.
///
/// # Requirement
///
/// The clock must be read at least once per wrap period (~129.9 s), or a wrap goes unobserved and
/// time loses an epoch. Satisfied structurally — the audio render path reads it continuously — and
/// guaranteed regardless by [`ostm0_overflow_isr`], which exists only to force one read per wrap.
