//! Pure firmware-image format logic for the Deluge SSB, with **no hardware
//! dependencies** so it unit-tests on the host and is shared by the on-device
//! `app-loader` — keeping the format decisions in one place.
//!
//! * [`elf`] — pure `PT_LOAD` classification used by the streaming SD loader
//!   (uncached-mirror resolution, SRAM-staging / SDRAM-direct decisions), and
//!   the [`elf::StreamRouter`] that routes a USB-uploaded ELF's segments
//!   straight to memory as they arrive, plus the FSB-metadata validation
//!   ([`elf::validate_fsb_metadata`]) the flash-store path runs before
//!   programming an image.
//! * [`crc`] — the shared CRC-32 the USB upload framing and the on-flash
//!   settings record agree on, so the host tool and the device compute the same
//!   checksum.
//! * [`settings`] — the encode/decode of the app-loader's persistent settings
//!   record (dev mode, auto-boot delay).
//!
//! The crate is `no_std`; `cfg(test)` pulls in `std` so the test harness works.
