//! Deluge SDK example: a polyphonic **additive** synth whose DSP core is
//! **C++/Argon** (ARM NEON SIMD) reached over **FFI**.
//!
//! It is the `test_osc` pad-keyboard synth — the 16-wide grid as an isomorphic
//! keyboard (one pad right = +1 semitone, one pad up = +5 = a perfect fourth),
//! with an OLED oscilloscope of its own output — but the per-block DSP is *not*
//! written in Rust. Every audio block, the active voices are handed to
//! [`additive_render`], a C++ function in [`csrc/additive.cpp`] that synthesises
//! the sound with [Argon](https://github.com/stellar-aria/argon), a header-only
//! zero-overhead C++ wrapper over NEON. Each voice is summed from up to 64 sine
//! partials (additive synthesis), four samples at a time in SIMD.
//!
//! This exercises two things at once:
//!   - **FFI** — Rust ↔ C++ over a C ABI ([`AdditiveVoice`] is shared
//!     field-for-field; the C++ is compiled by `build.rs` with `cc`);
//!   - **real-world SIMD DSP** — a vectorised parabolic sine + harmonic sum in
//!     Argon, on NEON (device) or SIMDe (`cargo deluge sim` host).
//!
//! **Timbre** is live: the **first gold encoder** sets the harmonic count
//! (1–32, brightness/bandwidth) and the **second** sets the spectral roll-off
//! order (0 = buzzy/equal, 1 ≈ sawtooth, 2–3 = darker). The OLED shows both.
//!
//! It is a **synth, not an effect**: it ignores codec line-in and writes its own
//! output — just press pads and listen.
