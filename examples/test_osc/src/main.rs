//! Deluge SDK example: the pad grid as an isomorphic synth keyboard.
//!
//! Turns the 16-wide pad grid into a polyphonic test oscillator. The layout is
//! *isomorphic* (note-layout independent of key): stepping one pad **right** is
//! +1 semitone and one pad **up** is +5 semitones (a perfect fourth) — the same
//! fourths tuning a bass guitar or a LinnStrument uses, so a chord or scale
//! shape is the same anywhere on the grid.
//!
//! It ties four SDK capabilities together: [`Input`] (pad presses), [`Pads`]
//! (LED feedback), [`Audio`] (per-block DSP), and [`Oled`] (an oscilloscope of
//! the synth's own output). Pad presses set per-voice frequency + gate through a
//! small lock-free shared state; the audio half reads it and sums up to
//! [`VOICES`] band-unlimited sine voices with a click-free amplitude envelope,
//! and also snapshots each output block into a scope buffer the OLED half draws.
//! All halves run concurrently via `join`.
//!
//! It is a **synth, not an effect**: it ignores codec line-in and writes its own
//! output, so no input signal is needed — just press pads and listen.
