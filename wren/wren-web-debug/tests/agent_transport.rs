//! Task 2.4: the transport-agnostic driver loop (`transport::serve`).
//!
//! `serve` is the same logic wren-dap's `spawn_driver`/`run_until_stop`
//! (`wren-dap/src/session.rs:48-179`, `262-281`) implement, generalized
//! from wren-dap's stdio/DAP-JSON transport to the `DebugTransport` trait
//! (`src/transport.rs`). This test proves the seam actually works end to
//! end with a real transport implementation: an in-memory `mpsc` pair.
//!
//! Threading mirrors wren-dap's own arrangement (VM runs on its own thread,
//! spawned inside `agent::debug_run`; the driver — here, `serve` — runs on
//! a second thread) — `serve` blocks on `recv_cmd`/`wait_event`, so it
//! can't run on the test's main thread while that same thread also needs to
//! feed commands and drain events.
