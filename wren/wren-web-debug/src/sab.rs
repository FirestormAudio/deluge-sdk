//! Task 3.2: a [`DebugTransport`] backed by a `SharedArrayBuffer` (a region of
//! the wasm32-wasip1-threads shared linear memory), so the *same* [`serve`]
//! driver loop that runs over an in-process `mpsc` pair in the native tests
//! (`tests/agent_transport.rs`) runs unchanged in a wasm worker, driven from
//! the JS main thread over shared memory.
//!
//! # Why this module only exists for the threads build
//! It uses `core::arch::wasm32::{memory_atomic_wait32, memory_atomic_notify}`
//! — the wasm `atomic.wait`/`atomic.notify` instructions — which are only
//! available when the module is compiled with the `atomics` target feature
//! (i.e. `wasm32-wasip1-threads`). So the whole module is gated on
//! `all(target_arch = "wasm32", target_feature = "atomics")` (see `lib.rs`):
//! the native rlib and the single-threaded `wasm32-wasip1` (Task 3.1) build
//! never see it and are unaffected.
//!
//! # SAB layout (SHARED CONTRACT with the JS controller — Task 3.3 must match
//! this byte-for-byte)
//! One contiguous region, base = [`sab_base`] (a zero-initialized `static`,
//! whose address the host reads via the exported `dbg_sab_ptr`):
//!
//! | bytes     | i32 idx | name        | writer  | meaning                                   |
//! |-----------|---------|-------------|---------|-------------------------------------------|
//! | 0..4      | 0       | `CMD_SEQ`   | main    | bumped when a command JSON is published   |
//! | 4..8      | 1       | `CMD_ACK`   | worker  | set to `CMD_SEQ` once the command is read |
//! | 8..12     | 2       | `CMD_LEN`   | main    | byte length of the command JSON           |
//! | 12..16    | 3       | `EVENT_SEQ` | worker  | bumped when an event JSON is published    |
//! | 16..20    | 4       | `EVENT_ACK` | main    | set to `EVENT_SEQ` once the event is read |
//! | 20..24    | 5       | `EVENT_LEN` | worker  | byte length of the event JSON             |
//! | 24..28    | 6       | `PAUSE`     | main    | pause request (reserved; see below)       |
//! | 28..32    | 7       | reserved    | —       | padding / future use                      |
//! | 32..8224  | —       | CMD region  | main    | command JSON bytes (main → worker)        |
//! | 8224..16416 | —     | EVENT region| worker  | event JSON bytes (worker → main)          |
//!
//! Both directions use a seq/ack handshake so a slow reader can never be
//! overwritten: the writer bumps `*_SEQ` (and `atomic.notify`s it) only after
//! the reader has acked the previous message via `*_ACK` (which the writer
//! `atomic.wait`s on). This makes [`SabTransport::send_event`] block until the
//! controller has drained the prior event — the SAB analogue of an unbuffered
//! channel, and exactly what lets `serve`'s back-to-back events
//! (`Terminated` + `Exited`; `Output…` + `Stopped`) survive a single JSON
//! slot without a queue.
//!
//! # `PAUSE`
//! Word 6 is reserved for an asynchronous pause request the VM's
//! `wren_core::vm::Pause` handle would poll (route pause *here*, not as a
//! `DebugCmd` through `serve`). This task wires the *layout* slot so the 3.3
//! TS controller and a future paused-VM build agree on the offset; the current
//! [`debug_run`] builds the session without a `Pause` handle, so nothing polls
//! it yet. See the task report.
//!
