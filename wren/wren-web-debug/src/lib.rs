//! Deluge Wren debugger core.

//! Runs the *same* deluge foreign bindings (from `deluge-wren-core`, the single
//! source of truth for the scripting surface) under **wren-core** — a wren VM
//! whose compiler is written in Rust and emits bytecode for the same upstream C
//! VM. Using wren-core (instead of the stock `wren-sys` path) gives us named
//! locals and source spans for free, which the source-level debugger needs.
//!
//! This crate depends on `deluge-wren-core` with `default-features = false` so
//! it links ONLY wren-core's copy of the C VM — never `wren-sys`'s — since two
//! upstream C VMs in one binary would fail to link.

// The SAB transport (`sab.rs`) uses the `atomic.wait`/`atomic.notify` wasm
// intrinsics, still nightly-unstable. Enable them ONLY for the threads build
// (where `sab` is compiled at all) so native / single-threaded wasm — which
// don't touch these — need no unstable feature.
