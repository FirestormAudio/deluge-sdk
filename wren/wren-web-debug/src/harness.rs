//! Harness Layer 1 (Task 1.3): run a deluge project's entry through the same
//! VM/prelude machinery as [`crate::build_vm`]/[`crate::run_project_capture`]
//! and expose the resulting engine state (CV/gate) so later phases (and the
//! debugger UI) can inspect what a script did.
//!
//! [`crate::build_vm`]/[`crate::run_project_capture`] install [`crate::NoopHost`]
//! — fine for compile/print-capture tests, but Output/Gate writes vanish into
//! it. This module installs its own recording [`Host`] instead (mirroring
//! `wren/wren-web/src/lib.rs`'s `WebHost` and `deluge-wren-core`'s test-only
//! `TestHost`, which the ungated harness can't reuse directly — see the
//! module docs on `deluge_wren_core::test_support`), so a run's CV/gate
//! writes are observable afterward via [`Harness::cv`]/[`Harness::gate`].
