# Task 3.2: build the threaded debug wasm (wasm32-wasip1-threads).
#
# Reuses the spike's recipe verbatim (task-3.2a-spike-report.md): the target
# spec already supplies the shared-memory/atomics linker args, and wren-core's
# build.rs (commit d36c2c4) compiles the C VM with matching wasm atomics for
# this target. -Zbuild-std rebuilds std for the threads target.
#
# We build the `dbg_threads` BIN (a command module with a real `_start` that
# bootstraps the main thread's TLS — see src/bin/dbg_threads.rs) rather than the
# cdylib. The `dbg_*` control functions the host calls after init are
# `#[no_mangle]` in the lib (src/sab.rs); in this toolchain those carry the wasm
# export attribute and flow through into the bin's exports (verified), so no
# explicit `--export` link args are needed.
