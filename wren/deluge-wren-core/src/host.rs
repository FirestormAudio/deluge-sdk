//! The `Host` seam: everything the Wren bindings need from the outside world.
//!
//! The foreign methods run inside the VM (a single thread per target: the
//! firmware's `vm_task`, or the web simulator's audio worklet). They reach the
//! hardware — CV/gate jacks, MIDI, LEDs, OLED, the audio engine — only through
//! this trait, so the *same* bindings drive a real Deluge and a browser tab.
//!
//! ## Registration
//! Because Wren's foreign methods are bare `extern "C"` callbacks with no context
//! argument, the active host is held in a process-global. Each target constructs
//! one `'static` host and calls [`set_host`] once at boot, before running any
//! script. Access is single-threaded (the VM thread), matching the rest of the
//! binding state.
