//! Firmware audio transport: the control→audio command ring, the engine
//! instance, and the render task.
//!
//! The DSP itself (the node graph, the [`Engine`], the [`Cmd`] vocabulary) lives
//! in the `flare` audio engine (`flare_graph`), shared with the web simulator
//! through `deluge_wren_core`. This module is the firmware-specific plumbing
//! around it.
//!
//! ## Concurrency
//! `vm_task` (via the `Node` bindings → [`FwHost::audio_cmd`](crate::host::FwHost))
//! only enqueues [`Cmd`]s onto [`CMD_RING`]; `audio_task` drains them between
//! render blocks. Node ids are handed out by the core's allocator so a foreign
//! ctor can return an id immediately without touching the graph.
//!
//! `ENGINE` is eager-initialized once by [`init_engine`], called from `main`
//! before any task is spawned — so no task can ever observe it uninitialized.
//! Every subsequent access is a freshly-derived, *scoped* `assume_init_mut`
//! borrow: `audio_task`'s per-block closure re-derives `&mut Eng` inside the
//! closure body (never held across the outer `.await`), and the pool accessors
//! (`upload_table`, `pool_set`, `alloc_buffer`, …) do the same. This is sound
//! because: (1) there is exactly one cooperative embassy executor with no
//! preemption; (2) every accessor is synchronous (no `.await` inside), so each
//! runs to completion without interleaving; (3) no accessor ever holds a `&mut Eng` across a `.await`,
//! so two overlapping borrows can never coexist; (4) `ENGINE` is written exactly
//! once, before either accessor can run, so `assume_init_mut` never observes
//! uninitialized memory; (5) no ISR touches `ENGINE`.
