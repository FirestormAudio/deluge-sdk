//! Persistent app-loader settings, stored in the SPI-flash **settings sector**
//! ([`flash::SETTINGS_ADDR`]) so they survive a power-cycle and do not
//! depend on the SD card.
//!
//! The only setting today is the **dev-mode** flag: when on, `boot_task` brings
//! up a USB CDC upload listener in the background (see [`crate::devupload`]) and
//! disables the auto-boot countdown so an upload can arrive at any time.  USB
//! firmware acceptance is impossible unless the user has explicitly turned dev
//! mode on, which is why it is persisted here rather than re-derived.
//!
//! The on-flash **format** (magic / version / flags / CRC) and its encode/decode
//! are the host-tested [`deluge_image::settings`] functions; this module only
//! adds the hardware read (memory-mapped window) and write (erase + program),
//! reusing the exact flash path the app-slot store uses.
