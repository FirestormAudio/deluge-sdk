//! `cargo deluge` — build and scaffold Deluge SDK apps.
//!
//! A thin host-side cargo subcommand so app authors never touch `-Zbuild-std`,
//! linker flags, or the embedded target triple. Pure std, no dependencies.
//!
//! Subcommands:
//! - `cargo deluge new <name>`  — scaffold a new app crate.
//! - `cargo deluge build [--release]` — build the current app → ELF.
//! - `cargo deluge run [--release] [--port <path>] [--log]` — build, then upload
//!   the ELF straight to a Deluge over USB (dev mode) and launch it from RAM.
//! - `cargo deluge deploy [--release] [--dest <sd-mount>]` — copy the ELF to a
//!   mounted Deluge SD card's `/APPS/` instead.
//! - `cargo deluge log [--port <path>]` — connect to a running app's USB
//!   serial-log channel (the `usb-log` feature) and stream it to stdout.
//! - `cargo deluge debug [--release] [-- <args>]` — build, then `probe-rs run`
//!   (J-Link).
//! - `cargo deluge trace [--release] [--flow] [--duration-ms N] [-- <args>]` —
//!   build, then `probe-rs read-trace` (J-Link, `trace-a9` fork).
//!
//! Apps are loaded by the app-loader as **ELF** and run from RAM; this tool only
//! ever emits an ELF (UF2 is the separate firmware-flash path).
//!
//! Each subcommand lives in its own module; this file is just argument dispatch,
//! the shared device constants, and the help text.

Usage: cargo deluge <command>

Commands:
  new <name>                 Scaffold a new Deluge app crate
  build [--release]          Build the current app for the Deluge (-> ELF)
  run [--release] [opts]     Build, then upload the ELF to a Deluge over USB and
                             launch it from RAM (requires DEV MODE on the unit).
                             The ELF is stripped to its loadable segments first.
                               --port <path>  serial port override (else auto)
                               --log          tail the app's USB log after launch
                               --no-strip     send the full ELF (debug info etc.)
  deploy [--release] [opts]  Build, then copy the ELF to a mounted Deluge SD card.
                               --dest <dir>   copy to <dir>/APPS/ (else print how)
  log [--port <path>]        Connect to a running app's USB serial-log channel
                             (the `usb-log` feature) and stream it to stdout.
                               --port <path>  serial port override (else auto)
  debug [--release] [-- ...] Build, then `probe-rs run` over J-Link (--chip set)
  trace [--release] [opts]   Build, then `probe-rs read-trace` (trace-a9 fork):
                               --flow         compact execution-flow view
                               --duration-ms N capture window (default 2000)
