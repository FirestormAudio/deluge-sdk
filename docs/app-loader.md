# App Loader Manual

The **app loader** is the second-stage bootloader from the Deluge SDK. Once
installed it runs every time you power the unit on: it puts a small boot menu
on the OLED and lets you pick which application firmware to launch — from
the SD card, from on-board flash, or straight over USB while you are developing.

This document is the operator's manual: how to install it, what each menu entry
means, and the day-to-day controls.

## What it is

The Deluge's *first-stage* bootloader (in SPI flash, untouched by the SDK) loads
the app loader from flash into SRAM at `0x20020000` and jumps to it. From there
the app loader is in charge: it brings the platform up, finds the firmware images
available to it, and hands control to the one you choose.

Apps are **ELF binaries that run from RAM**. The loader copies a chosen image's
`PT_LOAD` segments to their physical addresses, flushes the caches, and branches
to the image's entry point. Nothing your *app* does has to touch flash, so a
misbehaving app can never brick the unit — power-cycle and you are back at the
menu.

| Role | Second-stage bootloader / application launcher |
| Loaded at | SRAM `0x20020000` (by the first-stage bootloader) |
| Display | 128 × 48 OLED, encoder-driven menu |
| Boots from | SD card `/APPS/`, on-board flash slot, or USB (dev mode) |

## Installing the loader

The app loader is flashed onto your Deluge exactly like
a normal Deluge firmware update. The Deluge's first-stage bootloader programs the
`.bin` into what is typically taken up by the Deluge's firmware, making the loader the new default firmware.

1. Download the `app-loader.bin` from the GitHub Releases page.
2. Copy `app-loader.bin` to the top level of your SD card.
3. Insert the card, **hold SHIFT while powering on**.
   image. The binary should flash to the internal memory.
4. Power-cycle. You should land on the app-loader's **boot menu**.

Because it installs through the same update path as stock firmware, you can always
re-flash, including back to the previous Official or Community firmwares.

---

## Flash layout

The loader only ever writes to two regions of the SPI-NOR chip — the **app slot**
and its own **settings** sector. Both sit *above* the reserved first-stage
bootloader, device-settings, and second-stage-bootloader regions, so storing an
app or toggling a setting can never overwrite anything the unit needs to boot.

|--------|------|--------|----------|
| `0x000000` | 256 KB | First-Stage Bootloader (FSB) | no |

| `0x080000` | 512 KB | Second-Stage Bootloader (SSB) | no |
| `0x100000` | 2.75 MB | **App slot** (`SLOT_OFFSET`) — flashed app | **yes** |

| `0x3D0000` | 192 KB | unused / reserved tail | no |

The two writable windows are the *only* offsets the loader's flash routines will
erase or program; everything else is physically guarded.

## Boot sequence

On power-up the loader:

1. **Initialises the platform** — MMU, caches, SDRAM, GIC, and the OSTM timers,
   then the PIC link and OLED.
2. **Probes the on-flash app slot.** If a valid image is present it becomes the
   default boot entry, listed first as **`BOOT FLASH`**. This is independent of
   the SD card, so a unit with flashed firmware boots with no card inserted.
3. **Mounts the SD card** and lists ELF images from the `/APPS/` folder. A
   missing or unreadable card is not fatal — the menu just omits SD entries.
4. **Builds the boot menu** and shows it on the OLED, auto-booting the default
   entry after the configured delay (5 seconds out of the box — see
   [`SETTINGS`](#settings--auto-boot-and-dev-mode)).
5. **Launches your selection** — streams the chosen ELF, loads its `PT_LOAD`
   segments, flushes the caches, blanks the OLED, quiesces all DMA/timers/IRQs,
   and branches to the entry point. This never returns; the app owns the machine
   until the next power-cycle.

## The boot menu

```text
┌───────────────────────────────┐
│ BOOT IN 5s                  ▓ │   ← title bar (countdown, then "SELECT APP")
│ ──────────────────────────────│
│ ▶ BOOT FLASH                ▓ │   ← default entry (on-flash firmware)
│   MYSYNTH.ELF               ░ │   ← SD /APPS images
│   SEQUENCER.ELF             ░ │
│   DATA TRANSFER             ░ │   ← synthetic entries (always present)
│   SETTINGS                  ░ │
└───────────────────────────────┘
     scrollbar on the right edge ┘
```

The menu lists, in order:

1. **`BOOT FLASH`** — the image stored in the on-board flash slot, if one is
   present. This is the auto-boot default.
2. **Your SD `/APPS/` images** — every loadable ELF on the card, by filename.
3. **`DATA TRANSFER`** — a synthetic entry; see below.
4. **`SETTINGS`** — a synthetic entry opening the settings screen (auto-boot
   delay and dev mode).

Up to four entries are visible at once; a proportional scrollbar appears on the
right when the list is longer. A solid triangle (`▶`) marks the highlighted
entry.

### Controls

| Action | Control |
|--------|---------|
| Move the cursor | Turn the **SELECT** encoder |
| Launch the highlighted entry | **Short-press** SELECT |
| Store an SD app to flash | **Long-press** SELECT (hold ≥ 0.7 s) on an SD entry |
| Cancel the auto-boot countdown | Turn the encoder (any movement) |
| Exit a USB mode back to the menu | Press **BACK** |
| **Force the boot menu (recovery)** | **Hold LOAD while powering on** |

The countdown auto-boots the default entry after the delay set in
[`SETTINGS`](#settings--auto-boot-and-dev-mode) — **5 seconds** out of the box.
Turning the encoder cancels it and hands control to you indefinitely. It does not
run when there is no real boot target, when dev mode is on, or once you have
already been round the menu once this session (returning from `DATA TRANSFER`
will not boot out from under you).

### Recovery — always reach the menu

**Hold the LOAD button down while powering the unit on.** The loader
shows `RECOVERY`, then the boot menu with no countdown, waiting indefinitely —
whatever the auto-boot setting says.

This is the way back from an `AUTO-BOOT: INSTANT` unit whose flashed firmware is
broken: the loader runs before that firmware ever does, so the menu (and with it
`DATA TRANSFER`, re-flashing from SD, and `SETTINGS`) is always reachable.
Nothing is persisted — your auto-boot setting is left exactly as you set it.

---

## Synthetic menu entries

### `DATA TRANSFER` — SD card over USB

Selecting **`DATA TRANSFER`** exposes the raw SD card to the host as a USB Mass
Storage device, so you can drop ELF files into `/APPS/`, back up projects, or
reformat the card from your computer. Press **BACK** on the Deluge to leave this
mode and return to the menu.

This entry is always present, even when the card appears absent — the Deluge's
card-detect pin is unreliable, and the backend retries the card on demand when
the host probes it. With no card the host simply sees an empty drive; this also
guarantees the menu always has at least one entry.

### `SETTINGS` — auto-boot and dev mode

Selecting **`SETTINGS`** opens a screen with three rows:

```text
SETTINGS
▶ AUTO-BOOT: 5S
  DEV MODE: OFF
  BACK
```

- **`AUTO-BOOT`** — how long the menu waits before launching the default entry.
  Press SELECT to edit (the value is bracketed, `<5S>`, while live), turn the
  encoder to walk the dial, press SELECT to confirm, or BACK to cancel the edit.

  | Value | Behaviour |
  |-------|-----------|
  | `INSTANT` | The menu is **never drawn** — the default entry launches at once. Hold LOAD at power-on to get the menu back. |
  | `1S` … `20S` | The menu is shown and counts down, then boots the default entry. |
  | `NEVER` | The menu is shown and waits indefinitely. Dev mode's menu behaviour, without dev mode's USB listener. |

- **`DEV MODE`** — press SELECT to flip the persistent dev-mode flag. See
  [Dev mode](#dev-mode) below.

- **`BACK`** — leave the screen. Settings are written to the flash settings
  sector **on exit**, and only if you changed something; `SETTINGS SAVED`
  confirms, and the menu rebuilds with the new values. **Nothing is launched.**

If the flash write does not stick, the loader stays responsive and shows a
diagnostic line with the chip's JEDEC ID and status register (e.g.
`ID 01 02 20 SR..`) so a write-protected settings sector can be diagnosed.

---

## Dev mode

Dev mode is a **persistent, default-off** setting stored in the flash settings
sector (`0x3C0000`). Because it survives reboots and is independent of the SD
card, a stock unit will **never** accept firmware over USB until you explicitly
turn it on — turn it off again to lock the unit back down.

While dev mode is **on**, the loader:

- runs a USB **CDC-ACM upload listener** in the background, alongside the boot
  menu — there is no separate "upload mode" to enter; and
- **disables the auto-boot countdown**, so the unit waits indefinitely on the
  menu for either a menu selection or a USB upload. (This overrides `AUTO-BOOT`
  entirely, including `INSTANT`. If you want a menu that waits but no USB
  listener, set `AUTO-BOOT: NEVER` instead.)

This is the foundation of the push-to-run dev loop. With dev mode on, run:

```sh
cargo deluge run
```

The host frames your ELF (`DLUP | version | flags | len | crc32 | <ELF>`) and
pushes it over USB. The listener streams it into a high-SDRAM scratch window,
validates the CRC, loads its `PT_LOAD` segments to RAM, and launches it — exactly
like the SD `/APPS/` path, but with no card shuffling and no debug probe. Edit,
`cargo deluge run`, watch it run, repeat.

Making a menu selection while the listener is live tears the CDC device down
first, so a later `DATA TRANSFER` mode has the USB port free.

---

## Storing an app to flash

To make an SD app boot with **no card inserted**, store it into the on-board
flash slot:

1. Highlight the SD `/APPS/` ELF entry.
2. **Long-press** SELECT (hold ≥ 0.7 s). A `WRITE TO FLASH?` prompt appears.
3. Choose **`YES`**.

The loader flattens the ELF into a flat `.bin`, validates its first-stage-boot
(FSB) metadata, and programs it into the app slot (`0x100000`). A progress bar
tracks the flatten (first half) and the program (second half). On success it
shows `FLASHED OK / NOW DEFAULT` and the image becomes the first/default
**`BOOT FLASH`** entry on the next menu pass.

Safety notes:

- Only **fully SRAM-linked** images can be stored. The loader rejects anything
  that fails FSB validation *before* touching the slot, so a bad ELF can never
  corrupt an image already in flash. Errors are reported on the OLED
  (`BAD MAGIC`, `WRONG FORMAT`, `NOT FLASHABLE`, `TOO LARGE`, `VERIFY FAILED`,
  …) and the loader returns to the menu.
- Long-pressing the existing `BOOT FLASH` entry or `DATA TRANSFER` does nothing
  special — only SD ELF entries can be stored.

---

## Recovery

The loader is designed so you can always get back to a working state:

- **A bad app** can't brick anything — apps run from RAM. Power-cycle to return
  to the menu.
- **No SD card / unreadable card** — the menu still appears; use `BOOT FLASH`
  if a flashed image is present, or `DATA TRANSFER` to fix the card from a host.
- **A corrupt or unformatted card** — select `DATA TRANSFER` and reformat or
  repopulate `/APPS/` from your computer.
- **Locking a unit down** — turn dev mode **off** so it will no longer accept
  USB uploads.
- **Reinstalling the loader itself** — see the
  [Device setup guide](device-setup.md).
